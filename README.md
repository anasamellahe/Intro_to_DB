# Discovering Databases: An Easy Start for Beginners

Welcome to my database learning project! This repository marks the beginning of my journey into the world of databases and SQL. Through a series of practical tasks, I am gaining foundational skills necessary to work effectively with relational databases, specifically using MySQL.

## About This Project

This project guides beginners through the basics of databases — from understanding what databases are, the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, to mastering essential SQL commands. The project covers CRUD operations and introduces more advanced SQL techniques.

I am learning how to design and implement a real-world database schema by creating an online bookstore database, including tables for books, authors, customers, orders, and order details.

---

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Designing the Database Schema
- Designed a MySQL database named `alx_book_store` to store information for an online bookstore.
- Created tables for Books, Authors, Customers, Orders, and Order_Details with primary and foreign keys.

### Task 1: Creating the Database via Python
- Wrote a Python script (`MySQLServer.py`) to create the `alx_book_store` database.
- Ensured the script handles errors and does not fail if the database already exists.

### Task 2: Creating Tables
- Created all tables in the `alx_book_store` database using a SQL script (`task_2.sql`).
- Defined all table columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign key constraints.

### Task 3: Listing Tables
- Wrote a SQL script (`task_3.sql`) to list all tables in the `alx_book_store` database.

### Task 4: Describing Tables Without DESCRIBE or EXPLAIN
- Created a SQL script (`task_4.sql`) that provides the full description of the `books` table without using `DESCRIBE` or `EXPLAIN`.

### Task 5: Inserting a Single Customer
- Inserted a single row into the `customers` table (`task_5.sql`).

### Task 6: Inserting Multiple Customers
- Inserted multiple rows into the `customers` table (`task_6.sql`).

## Next Steps

I look forward to continuing this journey by exploring more advanced database concepts and SQL queries to build powerful and efficient data-driven applications.
